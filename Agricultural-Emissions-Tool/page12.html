    <h1 class="title">Manure Storage Covers</h1>
    <p class = "block">Stored manure emits gases such as methane and ammonia.
      Covering manure stores makes it possible to trap these emissions, 
      so that they may be treated before being released into the atmosphere.
       Captured methane can be burned to produce electricity.
       Another effect of covering manure storage is that the increased concentration of gas in the 
       air results in more molecules staying in the manure instead of being emitted
