    <p class = "block">Animals produce methane during the digestion of carbohydrates in their foods. 
      The methane emitted in cows' burps and farts is the greatest souce of agricultural emissions.
      What cows are fed can have an effect these emissions. 
      Supplementing a cow's diet with seaweed or red algae is expensive but results in a large reduction
       in emissions. Other feed additives are more affordable but result in a smaller reduction in 
       emissions.
